# How it works
This application was created using Knockout.js, the Google Maps API, and Wikipedia API. It loads a list of locations that the user can click to learn more about. Once clicked, the map focuses on the location and provides the user with custom information about the location along with an image that is pulled directly from the location's Wikipedia article. Users can also filter or search the map for specific locations.
